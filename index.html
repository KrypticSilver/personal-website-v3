          Hi, I'm Toby. I'm a 16 year old who is very interested in maths,
          science and computer programming. I started programming when I was
          about 13, completing simple tasks on websites like Codecademy and
          learning Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then started getting into some different sorts of projects when I
          was about 15 and using them for my computer science class, I build
          GUIs, games and lots of other fun things, this website is in fact one
          of my projects, I've had a lot of fun making it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was actually born in Brisbane, Australia, but moved to England when
          I was around 4. I prefer it in England, it's much, much cooler and
          there aren't so many deadly animals - I am glad to say that the Python
          I am associated with now, doesn't bite!.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really do like travelling and hope to do much more when I'm older.
          There seem to be some really great places in europe to go, and it's
          fairly close so I think that will be a place to visit in the future
          for sure!
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from programming, a few other hobbies I have are: walking,
          reading, computer games and mountain biking. Right now I live in
          Chantry, Somerset; It's quite rural so there are lots of nice walks
          you can go on and interesting places to explore which I love. Below
          are some photos which I really like.
