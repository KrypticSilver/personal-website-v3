        <h2>Professional</h2>
        <article id="professional-content">
          <p>
            I'd say I started recieving professional experience from around back
            in 2019(when I was about 14) when I joined the Orchid Project and
            Student Ambassador team - you can read more about those specifically
            in the "Experience" section of the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, I really wanted to get some more experience to prepare
            me for a professional environment and to help me narrow down what
            job I wanted in my future, to do this I did some research and
            engaged myself in several other experiences going into and
            continuing through the year of 2020. I advertised to do gardening
            services in the village that I lived in(and got several clients),
            worked as a social media manager and researcher for the Archetype
            Books publishing company which also had a location in my village,
            along with spending some time(made brief by COVID-19) time working
            at the Mells Cafe, quite close to where I live.
          </p>
          <p>
            From 2021, I really wanted to get into some more work to build up a
            portfolio of experience, understand how some businesses operate and
            further narrow down what type of job I wanted to work. To satisfy
            these conditions I continued with my local gardening service, joined
            the team at the Moat and Turret(based in Nunney - a small village
            near mine, with a nice castle), and did some work experience with a
            Data Science company based in Whatley as well as doing organizing
            and coordination for a man named Steven Shaw, who was moving house.

            Hi, I'm Toby. I'm a 16 year old who is very interested in maths,
            science and computer programming. I started programming when I was
            about 13, completing simple tasks on websites like Codecademy and
            learning Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then started getting into some different sorts of projects when I
            was about 15 and using them for my computer science class, I build
            GUIs, games and lots of other fun things, this website is in fact
            one of my projects, I've had a lot of fun making it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was actually born in Brisbane, Australia, but moved to England
            when I was around 4. I prefer it in England, it's much, much cooler
            and there aren't so many deadly animals - I am glad to say that the
            Python I am associated with now, doesn't bite!.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really do like travelling and hope to do much more when I'm older.
            There seem to be some really great places in europe to go, and it's
            fairly close so I think that will be a place to visit in the future
            for sure!
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from programming, a few other hobbies I have are: walking,
            reading, computer games and mountain biking. Right now I live in
            Chantry, Somerset; It's quite rural so there are lots of nice walks
            you can go on and interesting places to explore which I love. Below
            are some photos which I really like and thought would make the
            website a bit nicer.
