        Hi, I'm Toby. I'm a 16 year old who is very interested in maths, science
        and computer programming. I started programming when I was about 13,
        completing simple tasks on websites like Codecademy and learning Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then started getting into some different sorts of projects when I was
        about 15 and using them for my computer science class, I build GUIs,
        games and lots of other fun things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was actually born in Brisbane, Australia, but moved to England when I
        was around 4. I prefer it in England, it's much, much cooler and there
        aren't so many deadly animals - I am glad to say that the Python I am
        associated with now, doesn't bite!.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really do like travelling and hope to do much more when I'm older.
        There seem to be some really great places in europe to go, and it's
        fairly close so I think that will be a place to visit in the future for
        sure!
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from programming, a few other hobbies I have are: walking,
        reading, computer games and mountain biking. Right now I live in
        Chantry, Somerset; It's quite rural so there are lots of nice walks you
        can go on and interesting places to explore which I love. Below are some
        photos which I really like.
